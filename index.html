          Welcome to your fitness journey! Taking the first step is usually the
          most difficult thing for the majority of people, so congratulations
          for making it this far. In this document, we will explore the basics
          of fitness, the three pillars of hypertrophy, and the various levels
          of motivation experienced by trainees as they embark on this path.

          What is fitness? Physical fitness is to the human body what fine
          tuning is to an engine. It enables us to perform up to our potential.
          Fitness can be described as a condition that helps us look, feel and
          do our best.
        </p>
        <p>
          Physical fitness not only involves the performance of the heart and
          lungs, but also the muscles of the body. To improve the capabilities
          of our heart and lungs, we use cardiovascular or 'cardio' training,
          and for muscle building, we implement muscular hypertrophy methods
          into our programme. The word 'hypertrophy' means growth in size, and
          in our case, we specifically want growth in muscle tissue, hence
          'muscular hypertrophy' is our target. Also, since what we do with our
          bodies also affects what we can do with our minds, fitness influences
          to some degree qualities such as mental alertness and emotional
          stability.

          Most people could name some or all of the benefits of being physically
          fit. Some of which are to avoid illness, disease and injury, look
          better and have more energy; there are some additional unexpected
          benefits as well! Here are a few other benefits of fitness:
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>Control Stress</li>
              <li>Strengthen the Immune System</li>
              <li>Improve your Sex Life</li>
            </ul>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next section, we will talk about the 3 pillars of hypertrophy,
          starting with nutrition.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Nutrition">
        <header>Nutrition</header>
        <p>
          What you eat, and when, has a big impact on your energy level and how
          well you recover from a workout. Your body is a machine. And, like all
          machines, it needs the right fuel to run well — especially if you are
          active. But what foods should you eat to benefit your workout? And
          when?
        </p>
        <p>
          Rule #1: Start paying attention to the nutrition facts of the foods
          you eat. You might be surprised how many active adults overlook the
          importance of nutrition basics — and then run short on key nutrients.
          Not getting enough vitamins, minerals and other nutrients can
          compromise your health and your performance. Yet fueling up for
          activity is as easy as following the well-established rules of a
          healthy diet: Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, consume lean
          proteins, eat healthy fats, get your whole-grain carbohydrates, and
          drink plenty of fluids, especially water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rule #2: Focus your effort on whole foods. Whole foods are primarily:
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>Minimally Processed</li>
              <li>Free of Additives</li>
              <li>Richer in Nutrients</li>
            </ul>
          </code>
          Whole foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains (such as
          oats, brown rice and barley), nuts, beans, fish, shellfish and eggs.
          Minimally processed foods are foods that are a little processed, such
          as frozen produce or whole wheat flour. These foods are higher in
          nutrients, such as fiber, minerals and vitamins than processed foods
          and when they make up the majority of a diet, may lower rates of heart
          disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rule #3: Don't forget your protein. Protein is important because it
          provides the amino acids your body needs to build and repair muscle.
          Most research suggests very active people should eat 1.2 to 2 grams of
          protein per kilogram of body weight. That means a 150-pound person
          should eat 82 to 136 grams each day. Aim for at least .8 grams per
          kilogram of body weight each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good sources of protein are poultry (25 grams in 3 ounces) and fish
          (20 grams in 3 ounces). Those who prefer to avoid meat can try
          soybeans (20 grams per cup) and legumes like beans, peanuts and
          chickpeas (about 15 grams per cup). Eggs, Greek yogurt, cheese and
          tofu are good sources, too.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rule #4: Fuel up, even if your goal is to lose weight. Give your body
          the energy it needs to do the job you want — even if you are trying to
          lose weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skimping on nutrition can reduce muscle mass, lower bone density and
          cause fatigue. This puts you at risk of injury and illness, increases
          recovery time, causes hormonal problems, and, for women, menstrual
          issues. Make sure your diet plan supplies enough nutrient-dense
          calories so you can exercise and stay injury-free and healthy.
        </p>
        <p>Next, we will be talking about training!</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Training">
        <header>Training</header>
        <p>
          As discussed earlier in the basics section, there are two main ways to
          improve one's physical fitness:
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Increasing the Capabilities of the Heart and Lungs via
                Cardiovascular Training
              </li>
              <li>
                Building and Maintaining Muscle Mass and Strength via Resistance
                Training
              </li>
            </ul>
          </code>
          The two are equally important components of a person's health.
          Therefore, we have to consider adding <strong>both</strong> cardio and
          resistance training into our routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The keys to selecting the right kinds of exercises for developing and
          maintaining each of the basic components of fitness are found in these
          principles:
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Specificity</strong> - Pick the right kind of activities
                to affect each component. Strength training results in specific
                strength changes. Also, train for the specific activity you’re
                interested in. For example, optimal swimming performance is best
                achieved when the muscles involved in swimming are trained for
                the movements required. It does not necessarily follow that a
                good runner is a good swimmer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Overload</strong> - Work hard enough, at levels that are
                vigorous and long enough to overload your body above its resting
                level, to bring about improvement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Regularity</strong> - You can’t hoard physical fitness.
                At least three balanced workouts a week are necessary to
                maintain a desirable level of fitness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Progression</strong> - Increase the intensity, frequency
                and/or duration of activity over periods of time in order to
                improve.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Proper training is essential, but so is recovery! Let's explore more
          about that next.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Recovery">
        <header>Recovery</header>
        <p>
          How often you need to exercise to achieve muscular hypertrophy depends
          on your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could try one of these weight-lifting schedules:
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Lifting (especially heavy weights) three days a week. This
                allows you a day in-between sessions to let your muscles
                recover. Recovery is essential for muscle growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lifting just two days a week, depending on your current fitness
                level.
              </li>
              <li>
                Alternating between upper-body lifting and lower-body lifting on
                different days. This allows you to work different muscles while
                allowing time for rest and recovery.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          To become stronger, faster, and fitter, you have to push your body
          harder. But then you have to rest, too. All workouts, especially tough
          ones, stress the body. You’re fatiguing, or tiring out, various
          muscles when you work out, which means you’re causing microscopic
          damage to muscle cells.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't skimp on the rest and recovery part. Rest helps re-energize the
          body so you have the stamina to give it your all during your next
          workout. Workout recovery doesn’t just mean lying on the couch and
          kicking up your feet. The best post-workout recovery means using a
          variety of strategies to help your muscles heal. Here are some of
          those strategies:
          <code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Passive Recovery</strong> - A complete cessation from
                exercise, passive recovery is synonymous with complete rest. How
                much passive recovery your body needs depends on multiple
                factors, including your current fitness level and how intense
                your workouts are.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Active Recovery</strong> - Active recovery means
                low-intensity, generally low-impact exercise that promotes blood
                flow and tissue repair without further stressing the body. If
                you’re feeling fatigued from strength training, engage in a
                lower intensity cardiovascular bike ride or walk, which enables
                your body to circulate waste products caused by the rigorous
                activity. Or try a gentle yoga practice to stretch out tired
                muscles. Think of active recovery as anything you can do without
                getting winded or fatiguing your muscles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sleep</strong> - This is a large part of the recovery
                equation. During sleep, the body produces the majority of its
                growth factors and hormones that aid in daily muscle repair and
                recovery. Getting the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep
                per night allows those growth factors to do their work. Avoid
                screen time (TV, phones) and alcohol before bed and keep the
                room dark to help ensure quality sleep.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </code>
